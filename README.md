Soniclair is a minimal, mobile-ready, album-centered music client for subsonic compatible music servers built on top of [Capacitor] and [Tauri]

## Features

- Connect to any subsonic-compatible music server. Tested extensively on Navidrome.
- Browse your music collection by Artist or Album
- Album-centered music playing: if you start playing a song, the album becomes your playlist
- Start a radio based on any song on your library
- Search throughout your entire music library

## Roadmap
- Jukebox Mode (run an instance of Soniclair in an Android TV or TV Browser, or any browser hooked up to a nice screen and good speakers, and control it from another instance)
- Android Auto support
- Chromecast support

## Projects leveraged here

Soniclair is built upon

- [React JS]
- [React Window]
- [React Helmet]
- [Lodash]
- [VLC] (as an audio backend for android)
- [Dillinger] (used to write this README)
