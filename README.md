## An album-centered subsonic client for PWA, Android, Android TV and Desktop

SonicLair is a minimal, mobile-ready, album-centered music client for subsonic compatible music servers built on top of [Capacitor] and [Tauri]

## Features

- Connect to any subsonic-compatible music server. Tested on Navidrome.
- Browse your music collection by Artist or Album.
- Album-centered music playing: if you start playing a song, the album becomes your playlist.
- Start a radio based on any song on your library.
- Search throughout your entire music library.
- Android Auto support. (If downloaded v√≠a Play Store. This is a limitation imposed by Google.)
- Android TV support.
- [Android TV] Connect your TV to your server using your phone and a QR Code. (All the communications are made within the LAN, no third-party servers involved).

## Roadmap
- Jukebox Mode (run an instance of Soniclair in an Android TV or TV Browser, or any browser hooked up to a nice screen and good speakers, and control it from another instance)
- Chromecast support
